   - Dedicate one day a week to review weak areas (e.g., dynamic programming state transition equations)  

3. **Long-Term AI Learning Integration**:  
   - After mastering algorithms, prioritize studying Linear Algebra/Probability Theory (mathematical foundations for ML)  
   - Get familiar with the PyTorch framework (for deep learning practice)

By following this plan, I will systematically master core algorithm skills within **3-4 months** and lay a solid foundation for future learning in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). 
Adjust the pace dynamically according to individual progress, with the **core principle being "Understand the principles → Code repeatedly → Apply in practice."**
